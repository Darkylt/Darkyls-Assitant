  confession: |
    Confessions
    This bot has a confession functionality. You can use **/confess** to send a confession. You can then specify a text and optionally an Image that can be displayed in the embed in the command. The confession is then sent to the moderators. They can choose to either approve or decline a confession. If it is approved it appears in the confessions channel. If not you won't be notified since we don't store any information that links the confession to you.

    Confessions are entirely anonymous. No data is being stored that can be traced back to you.
    We temporarily store the confession text and Image in our database until the confession has either been submitted or dismissed. This is in order to make the bot function properly.

    The confessions need to follow the server Rules of course. Support for NSFW confessions might be added if requested.

  Here's a list of legit ways:
  - Nitro gifts are `discord.gift`
  - Discord staff always have a `Discord Staff` badge on their profile.
  - Free gifts from Discord will be in your `Gift Inventory` undr `User Settings`.
  - DMs from Discord are sent through an account with a `✔️ SYSTEM` next to their name, not bots.
  Here are some of the scams we're aware of and ways to deal with them:
  - A bot, sometimes even verified, sends you a legit-looking Nitro gift link in an embed, it hides a phishing link → Do not click on the link.
  - Someone is running a giveaway of any sort → Make sure the user has a giveaway role
  - Someone asks you to test their new game → Don't download the game.
  - Someone tells you they reported your Steam account → Do not engage.
  - Someone sends you a Steam trading link → Don't click it, go on Steam instead.
  - Someone sent an image that doesn't seem to load → Don't open the image in your browser, check your internet connection and reload Discord, if it still doesn't load it's a scam.
  - Someone is claiming you're being outed on a server for doing something bad that you know didn't happen → Do not join the server
  - Do not Scan QR Codes
  - Do not open images in your browser
  - Do not download untrusted files
  Enable 2FA if possible under `User Settings → My Account`.
  Leave servers that you are not active in.
  Under `User Settings → Privacy & Safety → Server Privacy Defaults` disable `Allow direct messages from server members`
